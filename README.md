# Usage

First you need to download the lasercut-box-openscad lib:
* If downloaded with `git clone` just run: `git submodule update --init`
* If otherwise downloaded, make sure to also download the [lasercut-box-openscad](https://github.com/larsch/lasercut-box-openscad/tree/0496a3a6516b91f7c5b02f35b9db21936ef27e01) lib and put it into the `lib/lasercut-box-openscad` folder.

Then you should be able to open the .scad file with OpenSCAD.  
To get a flat representation for laser cutting just uncheck the `assemble` option in the customizer of OpenSCAD.
